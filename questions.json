    "options": ["Substitution effect only", "Income effect only", "Substitution and income effects combined", "No effect"],
    "answer": "Substitution and income effects combined",

    "answer": "In equilibrium",
    "explanation": "MUx/Px = 4/2 = 2; MUy/Py = 10/5 = 2. Equal ratios imply equilibrium.",

    "answer": "More of a good is always preferred to less",
    "explanation": "Monotonic preferences imply non-satiation—more of any good is preferred.",

    "options": ["Normal", "Inferior", "Complementary", "Giffen"],

    "options": ["Normal", "Inferior", "Giffen", "Perfect substitutes"],
    "answer": "Normal",
    "explanation": "Upward-sloping ICC means consumption of both goods increases with income.",

    "options": ["Fall in real income", "Rise in money income", "Decrease in prices", "Improvement in welfare"],
    "answer": "Fall in real income",
    "explanation": "A lower IC shows lower utility—real income or purchasing power has decreased.",

    "explanation": "A fall in price makes the good cheaper relative to others, raising quantity demanded.",
